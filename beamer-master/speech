Intro 1:
To understand how the Hardware helps accelerating, first understand principles.
Explain Picture Neural Network Nodes, Weights, Input, Output. 
Different Nodes in each layer. Weighted function if above threshhold node activated. Changing weights learning simulated.

Intro 2:
Picture difference inference and training phase. 
Training phase input data compare with real data. Large Datasets needed. 
More computational power needed. Billions of multiplications in a single network one propagation.
Matrix-vector products large margin of computation.
